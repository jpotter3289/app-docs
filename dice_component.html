		<h1>Random Numbers Generator</h1>
		<p>
			This component gives the user the ability to make multiple random number generators. It received data on how many rolls it should make, a variable for what type of roll it should make according to the authors pre-set plan and then looks for a signal to make that roll.
		<p>
		<h2>Listener Channels</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Set label: </strong>listens for a channel that tells it which type of roll to make.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Add more rolls: </strong>listens to a channel to tell it how many rolls it should make at once.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Generate number(s): </strong>listens to a channel that signals it to generate a random number.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Output Channels</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Output new value(s): </strong>outputs the random number generated and how many times it gets generated out in integer form.
			</li>
			<h3>The default settings:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>label = 1</li>
				<li>highest # = 2</li>
				<li>lowest # = 1</li>
				<li># of times to generate = 1</li>
